<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user provided a large, single-file React application for a production tracking ERP system. The initial request was to review the code and improve any points that could cause problems for its healthy operation.

This request evolved. After identifying that the user's live version on Vercel had an authentication screen and was more advanced, the user clarified the final goal: **Create a similar application, modernized, based on the code shared at the beginning.**

The development is proceeding incrementally, module by module, with the user providing specific feature requests for each part:
1.  **Marketing Module:** Re-implement the full module.
2.  **Graphics Module:** Re-implement and ensure the Zet field is always visible, even for variant orders.
3.  **Warehouse Module:** Re-implement and add a new wastage/fire calculation system where the warehouse worker can input a wastage percentage to automatically calculate the gross material to be issued.
4.  **Planning Module:** Re-implement, ensuring all technical details, the customer deadline, and the gross warehouse meterage are clearly visible.

**User's preferred language**: Turkish

**what currently exists?**
A modernized, single-file React application with a Firebase backend. The UI has been updated with gradients, glass morphism effects, and improved layouts. The application successfully connects to the Firestore database and displays existing order data.

The following modules have been re-implemented in the new modern style:
-   Main App Shell & Department selection menu.
-   Marketing Dashboard (including advanced variant order form).
-   Graphics Dashboard (with the requested Zet field fix).
-   Warehouse Dashboard (with the new Wastage/Fire Calculation system).
-   Planning Dashboard (order list view with required data visibility).

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was implementing the **Planning Module**. It successfully created the order list view, ensuring that all technical details, the customer deadline, and the wastage-included warehouse meterage were prominently displayed on each order card, as per the user's request. The agent confirmed this UI was working correctly.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** Y (for the order list view)
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The agent has been resolving minor import errors as they occurred.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1:** Finalize the Planning Module (P0)
    -   **Where to resume:** The order list for the Planning module has been implemented and visually verified. The next step is to test the full functionality by selecting an order to view and interact with the detailed planning form and the calendar/schedule component.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A complete and functional modern Planning Dashboard.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   P0: Re-implement the **Production Dashboard**.
    -   P1: Re-implement the **Archive Dashboard**.
    -   P2: Re-implement the **Admin (User Management) Dashboard**.
    -   P3: Implement the proper **Authentication Screen** (Login, Register, Password Reset) as seen on the user's Vercel deployment. The current implementation uses a hardcoded admin role for testing purposes.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Application Modernization:** Began a full rewrite of the application with a modern UI/UX, including new CSS, gradients, and a glass-morphism-inspired layout.
-   **Marketing Module:** Re-implemented the full-featured Marketing dashboard for creating and managing orders, including the advanced variant/set functionality.
-   **Graphics Module:** Re-implemented the Graphics dashboard and fixed an issue where the Zet input field was hidden for variant orders, ensuring it is now always visible.
-   **Warehouse Module:** Re-implemented the Warehouse dashboard and added a new, user-requested Wastage/Fire Calculation System that allows users to set a wastage percentage and automatically calculate the total material to be issued.
-   **Planning Module (In Progress):** Implemented the order list view for the Planning module, with a special focus on clearly displaying all required technical, deadline, and material data on the order cards.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**
The project is a single-file React application.


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React (functional components with Hooks), TailwindCSS.
-   **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication).
-   **Architecture:** Single Page Application (SPA) where all components and logic reside in a single large file.
-   **APIs:** Google Gemini API is used for AI-based estimations.

**key DB schema**
-   **orders**: The main collection is located at . Each document represents an order and contains nested objects for data from different departments (e.g., , , , ).

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains the entire application's modernized code. This is the primary file being worked on.
-   : Contains the new base styles for the modern UI, including the background gradient.
-   : Updated to include a  to prevent issues with dynamically generated Tailwind classes.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
The entire application resides within a single 2500+ line  file. This is a significant source of technical debt and makes the code difficult to maintain, debug, and scale. The highest priority for refactoring should be to break this monolithic file down into smaller, reusable components (e.g., , , ).

**key api endpoints**
N/A. The application interacts directly with the Firebase SDK, not through REST API endpoints.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The core task is to continue the **modernization** of the application, building it module by module. Do not work on the original code.
-   The development workflow is: get a request for a module from the user, build it with any new requested features, test it visually, and then ask for the next module.
-   The application currently bypasses a full authentication flow by hardcoding the user role to  for ease of development in the preview environment. A proper login screen is an upcoming task.

**documents created in this job**
None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending user messages**
1.  **User:** Great, let's move on to the Warehouse. The net meterage comes from Graphics, but the warehouse worker needs to add wastage to it. Create a button/feature for the worker to select a wastage percentage, which then automatically calculates the total meterage to be issued. (Completed)
2.  **Agent:** Implementing the Warehouse module with the wastage calculation system. (Completed)
3.  **Agent:** Warehouse module is complete and tested. The wastage calculation system works automatically when the slider is moved. (Completed)
4.  **User:** Great, now let's continue with Planning. It's important that all technical details, the customer deadline, and the warehouse meterage are clearly visible. (Completed)
5.  **Agent:** Implementing the Planning module with a focus on displaying the requested details. (Completed)
6.  **Agent:** The Planning module is implemented. The order cards clearly show technical details, a highlighted customer deadline, and the wastage-included warehouse meterage in a separate box. (Completed)
7.  **Agent:** About to test the planning form by selecting an order. (Last action)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The application is not fully complete. Key modules like Production, Archive, Admin, and the main Authentication screen are still missing from the new modernized version.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Firebase:** Used for Authentication and Firestore Database. Requires user-provided Firebase config keys.
-   **Google Gemini:** Used for AI-powered estimations. The API key is stored as an environment variable.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None.
-   **Known regressions:** None.

**Credentials to test flow:**
No credentials are required. The application currently uses a development-only setup that grants 'admin' role automatically.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has correctly followed the user's incremental requests. However, the task of implementing a proper **Authentication screen** (Login/Register/Forgot Password), which was identified from the user's Vercel link, has not been started yet. This remains a key piece of the original application that needs to be added to the modernized version.</analysis>
